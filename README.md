# Personal Website

This project is my personal website highlighting my hobbies, skills, and some of my projects (designs, photography, and coding). I currently have two pages: the home page and the portfolio page.

I decided to make a website to allow me to keep all my projects in one space and have something to continue to add on to in the future. I plan on eventually including more pages and adding more extensions.

To make this website, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I coded it on VS Code and then pushed it to a repository on GitHub. 

While coding, I had to re-learn the basics of web development, as I hadn’t built a website in a few years. I watched many tutorials and had to re-learn all the basics. However, I was able to learn many new concepts, including classes and IDs in CSS to change up the style of my images/text.
